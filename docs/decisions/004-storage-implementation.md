# Storage Implementation Decision

## Context

As part of our transition from a license key system to Clerk for authentication, we needed to implement a robust storage solution that follows our phased migration approach while preventing serialization errors in Next.js Server Components.

## Decision

We've implemented a functional storage API that provides a clean abstraction over localStorage while maintaining compatibility with Next.js App Router architecture:

1. **Phase 1** (Current): Functional storage API with localStorage backend
   - Replaced direct localStorage access with functional wrappers
   - Prevented serialization errors with Class-based approaches
   - Maintained current behavior for user data

2. **Future Phase 2**: Same API with Supabase backend
   - Will maintain the same storage API interface
   - Will change implementation to use Supabase for cloud storage
   - Will support user association of data with Clerk IDs

## Implementation

The implementation includes:

1. **Storage Keys Definition**
   - Defined constants for all storage keys to prevent typos and inconsistencies
   - Created typed interfaces for safe access

2. **Functional API**
   - `getStorage<T>(key: StorageKey): T | null` - Read data from storage
   - `setStorage<T>(key: StorageKey, value: T): void` - Write data to storage
   - `removeStorage(key: StorageKey): void` - Remove data from storage
   - `clearStorage(): void` - Clear all app data from storage

3. **Compatibility Layer**
   - Maintained a backwards-compatible object interface for legacy code
   - Provided proper error handling and type safety

## Consequences

### Benefits
- Clean interface for storage operations
- No serialization errors with Server Components
- Easy future migration to Supabase
- Better type safety for stored data
- Minimal changes to existing component code

### Challenges
- Need to update all components to use the new API
- Need to implement data migration for users between environments (e.g., different ports)

## Migration Strategy

For users with data across different local environments (e.g., different ports), we will:

1. Implement a data export/import utility
2. Allow users to manually transfer data between environments
3. Eventually associate all data with their Clerk identity for seamless access

## Future Work

As we progress to Phase 2 of our migration strategy:

1. Update the storage implementation to use Supabase
2. Implement proper data sync with Clerk user IDs
3. Add offline support using localStorage as cache
4. Implement conflict resolution for multi-device scenarios
