# Decision Record: Storage Strategy

## Date
2025-03-07

## Context
The application currently stores all user data in browser localStorage, which works well for single-device usage but doesn't support cross-device synchronization. As we add authentication to enable multiple device access, we need to determine the best approach for data storage and synchronization.

## Options Considered

### 1. Continue with localStorage Only
- **Pros**: No changes needed, simple architecture, works offline
- **Cons**: No cross-device sync, limited storage space, data loss risk

### 2. Immediate Full Cloud Migration
- **Pros**: Complete solution, immediate cross-device capability
- **Cons**: Large development effort, potential disruption, offline challenges

### 3. Hybrid Approach (Phased Migration)
- **Pros**: Incremental path, reduced risk, continued service during transition
- **Cons**: Temporary complexity, multiple sources of truth during transition

### 4. Backend Service + API
- **Pros**: Complete control, custom solution
- **Cons**: Significant development effort, infrastructure management

### 5. BaaS Solution (Supabase, Firebase)
- **Pros**: Ready-made infrastructure, reduced development time
- **Cons**: Vendor dependency, potential limitations

## Decision
We will implement a phased migration to Supabase while maintaining localStorage capabilities, following the pragmatic middle path:

1. **Phase 1**: Add authentication with continued localStorage usage
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate user preferences to Supabase first
3. **Phase 3**: Progressively migrate other data types
4. **Final Phase**: Complete cloud migration with localStorage as offline cache

## Rationale
The phased approach offers several advantages:
1. Allows incremental development and testing
2. Maintains application functionality throughout transition
3. Provides immediate value to users (authentication) before full sync
4. Reduces risk compared to "big bang" migration
5. Builds toward a robust architecture without rushing

Supabase was selected because:
1. SQL-based (PostgreSQL) for flexibility and power
2. Real-time capabilities for sync
3. Row-level security for data protection
4. Good developer experience
5. Authentication capabilities (though we're using Clerk)
6. Reasonable pricing model

## Consequences

### Positive
- Path to cross-device functionality
- Incremental improvement
- Maintained offline capabilities
- Reduced risk during transition

### Negative
- Temporary architectural complexity
- Development spread across multiple phases
- Multiple data sources during transition
- Learning curve for new technology

## Implementation Plan
1. Add authentication (Clerk) while maintaining localStorage
2. Create database schema in Supabase matching current data model
3. Implement user preferences sync first (smallest data set)
4. Add tasks/priorities sync with conflict resolution
5. Migrate ideas and remaining data types
6. Implement real-time synchronization
7. Optimize offline experience

## Status
Planned
