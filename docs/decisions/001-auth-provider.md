# Decision Record: Authentication Provider

## Date
2025-03-07

## Context
The application currently uses a license key system through Polar.sh for validating user
access. However, user feedback indicates a demand for cross-device functionality,
which our current architecture doesn't support. We need to implement user
authentication to enable data synchronization across devices while maintaining our
existing licensing model.

## Options Considered

### 1. Continue License-Only Approach

* **Pros**: Minimal changes, familiar system, simple user experience
* **Cons**: No cross-device capability, limited user identity, no personalization

### 2. Custom Auth Implementation

* **Pros**: Complete control, tailored to our needs
* **Cons**: High development cost, security concerns, maintenance burden

### 3. Auth0 Integration

* **Pros**: Mature platform, extensive features
* **Cons**: Potentially higher cost, complex setup

### 4. Clerk Authentication

* **Pros**: Modern API, user-friendly, good developer experience, optimized for
  React/Next.js
* **Cons**: Newer service, potential vendor lock-in

### 5. Supabase Auth

* **Pros**: Integrated with database, simpler stack if using Supabase
* **Cons**: Less specialized than dedicated auth providers

## Decision
We will implement Clerk as our authentication provider while maintaining Polar.sh for licensing/subscription management.

## Rationale
Clerk offers several advantages for our use case:

1. Excellent developer experience with React/Next.js
2. Modern authentication options (social login, passwordless)
3. Simple integration path
4. Good documentation and support
5. Free tier for testing/development
6. Optimized for the technologies we already use

This approach allows us to:

* Add user identity without disrupting current licensing
* Prepare for cross-device synchronization
* Improve user experience with modern auth flows
* Maintain security best practices

## Consequences

### Positive

* Path to cross-device functionality
* Improved user experience
* Modern authentication options
* Separation of concerns (authentication vs. licensing)

### Negative

* Additional service dependency
* Integration work required
* User experience changes
* Possible confusion between licensing and authentication

## Implementation Plan

1. Add Clerk SDK to the project
2. Implement basic authentication flows
3. Update UI to reflect logged-in state
4. Associate license keys with user accounts
5. Migrate to cross-device authentication

## Status
Planned
