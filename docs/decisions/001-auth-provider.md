# Decision Record: Authentication Provider

## Date


2025-03-07

## Context

The application uses a license key system through Polar.sh for validating user access.
However, user feedback indicates a demand for cross-device functionality, which our
current architecture doesn't support. We need to implement user authentication to
enable data synchronization across devices while maintaining our existing licensing
model.

## Options Considered

### 1. Continue License-Only Approach

* **Pros**: Minimal changes, familiar system, simple user experience
* **Cons**: No cross-device capability, limited user identity, no personalization

### 2. Custom Auth Implementation

* **Pros**: Complete control, tailored to our needs
* **Cons**: High development cost, security concerns, maintenance burden

### 3. Auth0 Integration

* **Pros**: Mature platform, extensive features
* **Cons**: Potentially higher cost, complex setup

### 4. Clerk Authentication

* **Pros**: Modern API, user-friendly, good developer experience, optimized for
  React/Next.js
* **Cons**: Newer service, potential vendor lock-in

### 5. Supabase Auth

* **Pros**: Integrated with database, simpler stack if using Supabase
* **Cons**: Less specialized than dedicated auth providers

## Decision
We will implement Clerk as our authentication provider while maintaining Polar.sh for licensing/subscription management.

## Rationale
Clerk offers several advantages for our use case:

1. Excellent developer experience with React/Next.js
2. Modern authentication options (social login, passwordless)
3. Simple integration path
4. Good documentation and support
5. Free tier for testing/development
6. Optimized for the technologies we already use

This approach allows us to:

* Add user identity without disrupting current licensing
* Prepare for cross-device synchronization
* Improve user experience with modern auth flows
* Maintain security best practices

## Consequences

### Positive

* Clean separation of authentication (Clerk) and data storage (Convex)
* Improved user experience with Clerk's UserProfile component
* Modern authentication options (social login, passwordless)
* Successful separation of concerns (authentication vs. licensing)
* Smooth transition path for legacy users

### Negative

* Multiple service dependencies (Clerk, Convex, Polar.sh)
* Ongoing integration work for complete feature set
* Need for careful data migration strategy
* Temporary complexity during transition period

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 (Completed)

1. Added Clerk SDK to the project
2. Implemented Clerk UserProfile component for authentication
3. Moved user preferences to dedicated settings page
4. Preserved legacy user access


### Phase 2 (In Progress)

1. Integrate Convex for data storage
2. Implement phased migration from localStorage
3. Associate license keys with user accounts
4. Enable cross-device synchronization

### Phase 3 (Planned)

1. Implement Polar.sh webhook integration
2. Add team/organization features if needed
3. Complete migration from localStorage

## Status

Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 In Progress
