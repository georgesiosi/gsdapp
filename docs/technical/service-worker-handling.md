# Service Worker Handling

## Overview

The GSD App uses a careful approach to service worker management to prevent caching issues during development and deployment while still supporting progressive web app (PWA) features.

## Implementation

### Service Worker Unregistration

As part of the authentication migration to Clerk, we've implemented a robust service worker unregistration system that:

1. Safely unregisters any existing service workers to prevent caching conflicts
2. Uses a client-side component architecture to avoid server component errors
3. Implements delayed execution and error handling for reliability

### Key Components

The implementation uses a three-part architecture:

1. **ServiceWorkerRegistration Component** (`components/service-worker-registration.tsx`)
   - Handles the actual unregistration logic
   - Implements defensive coding with proper error boundaries
   - Uses a timeout to prevent blocking the main thread

2. **ClientComponent Wrapper** (`components/service-worker-wrapper.tsx`)
   - Serves as a client component boundary
   - Uses dynamic import with `ssr: false` to safely load the service worker code
   - Resolves Next.js Server Component limitations

3. **Root Layout Integration** (`app/layout.tsx`)
   - Imports the wrapper component
   - Places it at the top level of the application

## Technical Considerations

- Service worker code is carefully isolated from server components
- Error handling prevents crashes if service worker APIs aren't available
- The implementation is compatible with both development and production environments

## Future Enhancements

In the future, we may reintroduce service workers for features like offline caching once the Clerk migration is complete and we've fully implemented our cloud storage strategy.
