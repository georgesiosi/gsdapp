# System Architecture

## Overview

GSD App is a task management application designed to help users organize priorities,
tasks, and ideas in a streamlined workflow. The application is currently built with
a desktop-first approach but is evolving toward a cross-device architecture.

## Architecture Overview

Our architecture follows these principles:

* Principle 1
* Principle 2
* Principle 3

## Core Components

Our system consists of:

* Frontend
  * **Next.js**: React framework for the UI
  * **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
  * **LocalStorage**: Current primary data persistence layer
* Backend
  * **Next.js API Routes**: Serverless functions for backend processing
  * **OpenAI Integration**: AI-powered task analysis and idea detection
  * **Polar.sh Webhooks**: Subscription and license management

## Data Flow

1. User inputs tasks and reflections
2. AI processing categorizes content as tasks or ideas
3. Content is stored in appropriate collections
4. UI refreshes to display updated content

## Current Storage Strategy

The application currently uses browser localStorage for data persistence with the
following characteristics:

* User settings and preferences
* Tasks and priorities
* Ideas bank content
* No cross-device synchronization

## Planned Architecture Evolution

### Phase 1: Add Authentication

* Implement Clerk for user authentication
* Maintain localStorage for data (no sync yet)
* Update UI to reflect logged-in state

### Phase 2: Introduce Cloud Database

* Integrate Supabase or similar database
* Begin with user preferences sync
* Maintain offline capabilities

### Phase 3: Complete Cloud Migration

* Move all data to cloud storage
* Implement real-time sync across devices
* Develop conflict resolution strategies
