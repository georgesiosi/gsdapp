# Synchronization Strategy

## Current State

The application currently has no cross-device synchronization:

* Data stored exclusively in browser localStorage
* Each device maintains its own independent data store
* No conflict resolution needed (isolated instances)

## Planned Synchronization Evolution

### Phase 1: User Authentication (No Sync)

* Add user authentication via Clerk
* Continue using localStorage for data storage
* No data synchronization between devices
* Clearly communicate to users that data remains device-specific

### Phase 2: Basic Cloud Synchronization

* Implement cloud database (Supabase) for user preferences
* One-way synchronization from cloud to device on login
* Simple "last write wins" conflict resolution
* Offline capabilities maintained through localStorage

### Phase 3: Real-time Synchronization

* Complete migration of all data to cloud storage
* Bi-directional sync between devices
* Offline-first approach with background synchronization
* Conflict resolution for concurrent edits

## Offline Capabilities

* Application will function without internet connection
* Local changes queue for synchronization when online
* Periodic sync attempts when network is available
* Visual indicators for sync status

## Conflict Resolution Strategy

1. **Timestamp-based Resolution**
   - Each data change tracked with server timestamp
   - Last write wins for most data types
   - Conflicts logged for review

2. **Smart Merging** (Future Enhancement)
   - Non-destructive merging where possible
   - For lists (tasks, ideas), append conflicting items
   - For simple values, use most recent

3. **User Resolution** (When Necessary)
   - Notify users of significant conflicts
   - Provide interface to choose between versions
   - Option to keep both versions

## Technical Implementation

* Supabase Realtime or similar for live updates
* Client-side queue for offline changes
* Optimistic UI updates during sync operations
* Background synchronization worker

## Performance Considerations

* Selective synchronization of needed data
* Pagination for large data sets
* Optimized query patterns
* Cache management to reduce bandwidth
