# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The GSDApp is currently focused on enhancing the task management experience with a particular emphasis on:

1. **AI-Powered Task Analysis**: Improving the automatic categorization of tasks into the appropriate Eisenhower Matrix quadrants using OpenAI.

2. **Performance Metrics**: Developing the end-of-day scorecard system to provide users with insights into their productivity and task completion patterns.

3. **Ideas Bank Integration**: Implementing the Ideas Bank feature to help users separate actionable tasks from ideas that need further development.

4. **UI Refinements**: Enhancing the user interface with drag-and-drop functionality, visual feedback, and responsive design improvements.

## Recent Changes

1. **Task Management System**:
   - Implemented the core Eisenhower Matrix UI with four quadrants
   - Added drag-and-drop functionality for task reordering and quadrant reassignment
   - Integrated AI-powered task analysis for automatic categorization

2. **Scorecard System**:
   - Developed end-of-day scorecard generation with metrics and insights
   - Created scorecard history visualization with charts
   - Added personal reflection capabilities to scorecards

3. **Authentication**:
   - Integrated Clerk for user authentication
   - Implemented user profile management

4. **Data Storage**:
   - Set up Convex for backend data storage and real-time updates
   - Implemented data migration utilities for local storage to Convex

## Next Steps

1. **Ideas Bank Enhancement**:
   - Complete the Ideas Bank feature for storing and managing ideas
   - Implement idea-to-task conversion functionality
   - Add priority connection detection for ideas

2. **AI Improvements**:
   - Enhance error handling and fallback strategies for AI analysis
   - Implement batch processing for multiple tasks
   - Add more context-aware analysis based on user goals and priorities

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize rendering performance for large task lists
   - Implement virtualization for task lists
   - Reduce unnecessary re-renders with memoization

4. **Mobile Experience**:
   - Enhance responsive design for mobile devices
   - Implement touch-friendly interactions for the Eisenhower Matrix
   - Optimize performance on mobile devices

## Active Decisions

1. **AI Integration Strategy**:
   - Using OpenAI for task analysis with local API key management
   - Implementing progressive enhancement so core functionality works without AI
   - Providing clear feedback during AI processing with fallback mechanisms

2. **Data Synchronization**:
   - Using Convex for real-time data synchronization
   - Implementing optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback
   - Providing offline capabilities with local storage fallback

3. **UI/UX Approach**:
   - Focusing on visual clarity and intuitive interactions
   - Using Shadcn UI components for consistent design
   - Implementing dark mode support

## Important Patterns & Preferences

1. **Component Structure**:
   - Container components for logic (e.g., TaskManager)
   - Presentation components for UI (e.g., EisenhowerMatrix)
   - Custom hooks for reusable logic (e.g., useTaskManagement)

2. **State Management**:
   - Local state for component-specific state
   - Zustand for shared application state
   - Convex for persistent data storage

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful degradation for AI features
   - Clear user feedback for errors
   - Fallback strategies for critical functionality

4. **Code Organization**:
   - Feature-based directory structure
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Consistent naming conventions

## Learnings & Project Insights

1. **AI Integration Challenges**:
   - Handling API rate limits and timeouts
   - Balancing AI processing time with user experience
   - Providing meaningful fallbacks when AI is unavailable

2. **User Experience Insights**:
   - Users need immediate feedback when adding tasks
   - The Eisenhower Matrix concept requires clear visual differentiation
   - Performance metrics are most valuable when actionable

3. **Technical Insights**:
   - Event-based communication works well for cross-component updates
   - Custom drag-and-drop implementation provides better control than libraries
   - Memoization is critical for performance with complex UI components
