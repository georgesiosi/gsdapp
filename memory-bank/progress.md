## Known Issues

1. **AI Analysis Reliability**
   - Occasional timeouts with OpenAI API
   - Rate limiting can affect user experience
   - Analysis quality varies based on task description clarity

2. **Performance Concerns**
   - Large task lists can cause rendering slowdowns
   - Initial load time can be improved
   - Mobile performance needs optimization

3. **UI/UX Refinements Needed**
   - Some touch interactions are not intuitive on mobile
   - Drag and drop could be more discoverable
   - Task creation flow could be streamlined

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Authentication Strategy
- Initially planned to use NextAuth.js
- Switched to Clerk for better Next.js integration and user management features
- Decision has proven successful with simplified auth flow

### Database Selection
- Started with local storage for simplicity
- Evaluated Firebase, Supabase, and Convex
- Selected Convex for real-time capabilities and simplified backend
- Added migration utilities to transition from local storage to Convex

### AI Integration Approach
- Initially planned to use AI for all task categorization
- Evolved to a hybrid approach where users can manually categorize tasks
- Added progressive enhancement so core functionality works without AI
- Implemented client-side API key management for flexibility

### UI Component Strategy
- Started with custom components
- Switched to Shadcn UI (built on Radix UI) for accessibility and consistency
- Added custom styling and animations for better user experience
